# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Authenticate by sending a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Get your token by calling the <b>Login</b> or <b>Register</b> endpoint.
